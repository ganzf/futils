# Introduction to futils

Welcome ! Futils is an open-source collection of ```c++``` header-only utils.

## Github

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/ganzf/futils)

## Utils

In the ```utils``` folder you'll find all the ```*.hpp``` files you may need. The collection is rather small and unimportant for now, but it'll grow in size over time.

### Tests

You'll find unit tests (not enough probably) in the ```tests``` folder.

## Projects

### Fender

Fender is a **modern c++ game engine** that supports (not yet, but soon) 2d and 3d rendering.
